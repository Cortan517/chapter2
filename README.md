# Creating a Hello World App
In this chapter, I learned how to create a simple "Hello World" app using Flutter. I discovered how to initialize a new Flutter project and run it on an emulator or . I also learned how to use hot reload to instantly reflect changes made to the app without restarting it, speeding up the development process. The chapter taught me how to style the app by applying themes, allowing me to customize the look and feel of the application. I also explored when to use a stateless widget for static content and a stateful widget for dynamic content that changes during the app's lifecycle. Additionally, I learned how to integrate external packages into the app, expanding its functionality by adding libraries and dependencies from Flutterâ€™s package ecosystem. This chapter provided a hands-on introduction to building a basic app and customizing its behavior and appearance.
